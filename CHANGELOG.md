# Changelog

All notable changes to **byteworkz** will be documented in this file. The format
loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-15 — "app interior polish"

The 0.3.0 polish landed mostly on the hub. This one targets the actual
apps — the bits the user spends 99% of their time in.

### byteSheet

- **Excel-style row + column header highlight.** Clicking C5 now highlights the C column header AND the 5 row header with an orange tint + accent text. Makes "where is the active cell?" instantly readable across a wide grid. Updates with selection drag, arrow-key navigation, click — anywhere the selection moves. Cleared automatically when selection changes.
- **Subtle cell hover state.** Hovering a cell paints it with 4% accent — Excel does this, Sheets doesn't. Doesn't compete with selection or range visuals since the tint is well below those.
- **Status bar as chips.** Was: plain pipe-separated text. Now: dark pill chips with accent labels (`CELL A1`, `∑ 1234`, `x̄ 411`, `N 3`). The active-cell chip gets an orange-tinted border + glowing strong text.
- **Accent text selection** inside cell editor and formula bar — orange-tinted background instead of browser default blue.

### byteDoc

- **Status bar as chips.** Same chip system as byteSheet. `W 142`, `C 891`, `¶ 12`, brand right-aligned.
- **Accent text selection** in the editor body — orange-tinted, visible across body / headings / bold / etc.
- **Editor focus ring.** When the editor has focus, border picks up a soft 25% accent + a 3px outer halo. Subtle — only there when you're writing.

### Shared

- **Save indicator animations.**
  - `saving` → pulsing accent dot with a soft glow (1.1s ease-in-out infinite, opacity + scale).
  - `saved` → green dot pop (0.4 → 1.3 → 1, cubic-bezier soft).
  - `error` → red dot quick horizontal shake.
- **Polished button dividers** — vertical gradient line instead of flat 1px, fades at the ends so the divider has presence without being a hard rule.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-15 — "visual polish"

Top-to-bottom design refresh, voidcore-aligned. No functional changes —
this release is pure aesthetics. Same JS, same persistence, same
feature set. CSS-only.

### Hub

- **Wallpaper background**: two radial gradients (orange top-left, teal bottom-right) layered over a faint 40×40px grid masked with a radial fade. Mirrors the voidcore desktop feel adapted for a single-page app.
- **Wordmark redesigned**: 56px ultra-thin (font-weight 200), -0.04em letter-spacing, accent-coloured first letter with a halo glow.
- **Tiles relifted**: gradient surfaces (`linear-gradient(155deg, …)`), multi-layer drop shadows, hover halo (radial gradient on top edge fades in), translate-Y lift, icon scale + glow. Active state has a press-down tactile feel.
- **Recent rows**: hover slides right 2px, delete button only appears on hover (reduces visual noise at rest), badge is now a pill with monospace caps.
- **Section title accent**: `// Recent` prefix in monospace, accent-coloured — picks up the voidcore comment-style typography motif.

### Topbar

- **Glassmorphic** (`backdrop-filter: blur(14px) saturate(140%)`) with feature-detect fallback to solid surface.
- Brand mark gets a `drop-shadow(0 0 8px accent-glow)` filter.
- Version chip is now a pill with mono font on dark background instead of bare text.

### Buttons

- Bigger radius (`--radius: 4px → 8px`, `--radius-lg: 8px → 14px`).
- Primary button: vertical gradient (`--accent-2 → --accent`), inset highlight, expanding glow on hover, press-down on active.
- Icon buttons: transparent at rest, subtle bg on hover (less visual chrome by default).
- Disabled state explicitly cancels hover transforms.

### Doc editor

- **Paper feel**: editor card now sits on a slightly-radial background, has 80px horizontal padding, larger radius (14px), multi-layer shadow, top inner highlight stroke.
- **Typography**: body 15.5px / 1.72 line-height (was 15 / 1.65). Headings get tighter letter-spacing.
- **Links**: underlined with 40% accent decoration; goes to full accent on hover.
- **List markers**: orange (`li::marker`).
- **Blockquote**: subtle orange-tinted background + rounded right corner.
- **Images**: drop-shadow at rest, accent-glow when selected.
- **Tables**: gradient header background, rounded corners (overflow hidden so cells fit the radius).
- **Find bar**: slides in from top, focus state gets a 3px outer ring in accent-dim.
- **Find highlights**: 1px accent-tinted box-shadow ring; active match glows.

### Sheet grid

- **Headers**: vertical gradient, accent-coloured on hover; row-head + col-head get a stronger border on the body-facing edge.
- **Formula bar**: cell-ref label in accent colour and bold mono; input gets a 3px accent-dim focus ring.
- **Active cell**: outline + inset accent-dim glow.
- **Cell editor**: inset orange glow while editing.
- **Sheet tabs**: active tab gets a top accent bar with bottom glow (mirrors doc-tabs treatment).
- **Charts**: gradient header bar, stronger drop shadow.
- **Filter popover**: glassmorphic.

### Motion

- New motion tokens (`--t-fast: 120ms`, `--t-norm: 200ms`, `--t-soft: 280ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)`).
- View transitions: 220ms fade + 4px translate-up.
- Modal: scale(0.94)+8px-down → identity, 220ms, soft cubic-bezier. Backdrop blurs in over 180ms.
- Toast: 10px lift + scale(0.96) → identity.
- Context menu: drops in with subtle scale.
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` zeroes all animations + transitions globally.

### Scrollbars

- Webkit: 10px wide, 6px-radius accent-on-hover thumb on transparent track, padding inset of 2px so the thumb looks floating.
- Firefox: `scrollbar-width: thin; scrollbar-color: border-strong transparent`.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-15 — "audit pass 2"

Second `/byteside:debug-web-loop` pass, deeper into the formula engine
and storage layer. Three small defensive fixes — no user-visible
behaviour changes except correct error reporting on malformed formulas.

### Fixed (MINOR)

- **Tokenizer silently truncated unterminated string literals.** `="abc` with no closing `"` produced a successful STR token (value `"abc"`) and trailing source content vanished. Now throws `#ERROR! unterminated string`, matching Excel. Two new test cases lock the behaviour down.
- **`colToNum` defensively uppercases input.** The function is exported; an external caller (or manually-edited JSON) passing `'a'` would previously get 33 (`97 - 64`) instead of 1, silently mis-targeting cells. Internal callers always pass uppercase (via `parseRefMatch`'s `.toUpperCase()`), so no regression — just a hardened API surface.
- **`evictOldestUntilFits` final `setItem` was unguarded.** On browsers that bill quota against an in-progress write, the recent-list write could itself throw `QuotaExceededError` after we'd already evicted blobs — leaving recent list and blob inventory inconsistent. Wrapped in try/catch; self-heals on next save.

### Tests

- **107/107** (up from 105). Two new cases for unterminated-string error paths.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-15 — "audit pass"

Systematic codebase scan ([/byteside:debug-web-loop]) turned up one security
issue and one rare UI bug.

### Security (KRITISCH)

- **XSS hardening in byteDoc** — a hand-crafted `.bytedoc.json` (or a directly tampered localStorage entry) could previously inject scripts via attributes the old blacklist didn't cover: `onmouseover`, `onfocus`, `onpointerdown`, `formaction`, `srcdoc`, and many others. The sanitizer is now **whitelist-based**: per-tag enumeration of allowed attributes (`A` → `href`/`target`/`rel`, `IMG` → `src`/`alt`/`width`/`height`, everything else → zero attrs). Plus `href` must match `https?:|mailto:|tel:|ftp:|#|/|.` and `src` must match `data:image/...|https?:` — `javascript:`, `data:text/html`, `vbscript:` all get stripped.
- **Sanitize on load, not just on paste** — `setActive()` now runs `sanitizeHTML()` on the doc body before assigning to `editor.innerHTML`. Without this, malicious html persisted from any source (file open, dev-tools tamper, pre-0.2.3 entries) would re-execute on every mount. Self-healing: the next debounced save writes the cleaned html back to localStorage.

### Fixed (MINOR)

- **Context menu spurious close** (`ui.js`) — opening two context menus in rapid succession left the first menu's `{once: true}` outside-click listener stale-attached. The next click anywhere triggered it, found its (gone) menu didn't contain the target, and called `closeContextMenu()` — closing the *second* menu. The handler is now tracked explicitly and removed in `closeContextMenu()`. Side benefit: also clamps menu position to `Math.max(2, …)` so a small viewport / large menu doesn't render off-screen left.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-15 — "byteDoc focus"

byteDoc hadn't had a focused release in seven versions; this one is.

### Added — snapshot undo/redo

- **Per-tab linear history stack** (cap 100 entries) replaces reliance on the deprecated browser-native `document.execCommand` undo. Each entry stores `{html, sel}` where `sel` is a DOM-path encoding of the caret/range. Undo restores both content **and** caret position.
- **Keyboard**: `Ctrl+Z` undo, `Ctrl+Y` and `Ctrl+Shift+Z` redo. Intercepted with `preventDefault` so the browser's native stack doesn't fight ours.
- **Toolbar buttons**: ↶ Undo / ↷ Redo, leftmost in the toolbar.
- **Commit timing**: idle typing commits 700 ms after the last input. Structural operations (table insert, image insert, paste, formatting via execCmd, link insert, image resize, find-replace, row/col add/delete, table delete) commit synchronously — they don't fire `input` events on contenteditable reliably and would otherwise be invisible to undo.
- **Stack hygiene**: identical-html commits are no-ops. Switching tabs commits the outgoing tab's state into its own per-tab stack before navigating, so edits aren't dropped or attributed to the wrong tab. Undo branches are truncated on the next commit (standard linear-history semantics).

### Fixed

- **Find-bar `<mark>` wrappers no longer leak into persistence**. With the find bar open, the editor's innerHTML contained transient `<mark class="find-hit">` elements; the debounced autosave was writing those into localStorage, so they survived reload. Added a `cleanHtml()` helper that strips them; called from `saveDebounced`, `doDownload`, `doExportHtml`, snapshot commits, and the outgoing-tab capture in `setActive` / `unmount`.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed (completes the v0.2 spreadsheet-parity story)

- **Sort now updates formula refs** to follow the physically-moved cells. Single refs (`=A1`, `=$A$1`, `=Sheet2!A5` from other sheets pointing back at the sorted sheet) all track to the cell's new row. Range boundaries (`SUM(A1:A3)`) are deliberately preserved — the data within a range gets reordered, not relocated, so `SUM(A1:A3)` after sorting rows 1-3 still sums the same physical cells.
- **Absolute refs follow during sort** (Excel semantics): `=$A$1` becomes `=$A$3` if the cell at A1 sorted to A3, because `$` means "this specific cell" — and that cell physically moved. This differs from insert/delete where `$` means "row 5 specifically, regardless of shifts". Implemented via `{force:true}` option on `shiftRef` / `shiftRange`.
- **Refs in other sheets that target the sorted sheet** now also update (e.g., `=Sheet1!A2` in Sheet2 becomes `=Sheet1!A5` if Sheet1's row 2 sorted to row 5).

### Tests

- 105/105 (was 100). 5 new sort scenarios: bare refs, absolute refs, range preservation, out-of-sort-range rows, cross-sheet specificity.

### v0.2 milestone closed

Spreadsheet feature parity now covers: formula re-targeting on insert/delete row+col (v0.1.8), sheet-rename ref updates (v0.1.9), 17 new functions including VLOOKUP / SUMIF / INDEX / MATCH / dates / strings, cycle detection, persistent filter (v0.2.0), and sort-refs (v0.2.1). Remaining known limitation: deleting an absolute column still leaves the absolute ref intact instead of emitting `#REF!` — small follow-up.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-15 — "Spreadsheet feature parity"

The four-commit milestone (v0.1.7 → v0.1.8 → v0.1.9 → v0.2.0) closes the
biggest correctness and feature gaps in byteSheet relative to user
expectations from real spreadsheets.

### Added — formula library expansion (17 new functions)

- **Lookup**: `VLOOKUP(value, range, col_index, [exact])`, `INDEX(range, row, [col])`, `MATCH(value, range, [type])` (exact match + approximate for ascending/descending)
- **Conditional aggregates**: `SUMIF(range, criterion, [sum_range])`, `COUNTIF(range, criterion)`, `AVERAGEIF(range, criterion, [avg_range])`. Criterion syntax: `">100"`, `"<=50"`, `"<>x"`, or a literal for equality
- **Date / time**: `TODAY()`, `NOW()`, `DATE(y, m, d)`, `YEAR(v)`, `MONTH(v)`, `DAY(v)` (epoch-ms underlying type)
- **Text slicing**: `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `FIND`, `SUBSTITUTE` (with optional nth-occurrence), `REPLACE` (Excel-style: `text, start, length, new`)
- **Numeric**: `SIGN`, `TRUNC`

### Added — cycle detection

- `markCycles()` runs Tarjan's SCC algorithm on the formula dep graph after `fullRecompute` and `recomputeDependents`. Cells in non-trivial SCCs (size > 1, or single cell with self-loop) are marked `#CYCLE!`. Before this release, a cycle like `A1 = B1, B1 = A1` would silently exhaust the 30-pass-cap and leave both cells at whatever number the last pass produced.

### Added — persistent filter

- `sheet.filter = { col, allowed: [...] }` now persists on the sheet object. Filter survives sheet switches, structural edits (insert/delete row/col), save/load. The filter modal pre-populates checkboxes from the existing filter and offers a "Clear filter" button when one is active. "Apply all" auto-clears the filter.

### Range tokens now carry 2D shape

- `RANGE` evaluation produces `{__isArray:true, values, rows, cols}` so the new lookup functions can navigate 2D grids (row-major). The existing aggregate functions ignore the shape — backwards compatible.

### Tests

- 100/100 (was 74). New cases: 8 string-slicing, 5 numeric extras, 5 conditional-aggregate, 5 lookup, 3 date.

### Known limitations remaining (deferred)

- **Sort** still doesn't update formula refs in moved rows. Sort moves data faithfully, but a formula like `=A1` inside a row that gets sorted to position 5 keeps pointing at A1 instead of tracking the moved cell. Requires "rows-as-units" semantics in the sort which the current implementation doesn't model.
- **Deleting an absolute column** (e.g. `$B$2` after delete column B) leaves the absolute ref intact rather than emitting `#REF!`. Marked in the test suite.
- **Filter on a column that's then inserted/deleted into**: the filter's stored `col` letter stays pointing at the same column letter, which now refers to different data after the shift. Manual re-apply needed for now.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **Renaming a sheet now updates every cross-sheet reference** in every formula across the whole document. Before this release, renaming `Sheet1` → `Q1` left `=Sheet1!A1` literally as-is, so every dependent cell broke silently. Now: walks all sheets, all formula cells, rewrites refs that targeted the renamed sheet to use the new name (quoted with `'…'` and `''`-escaped if the new name has spaces, special chars, or apostrophes — Excel-style).
- **Duplicate / empty sheet-name protection.** Trying to rename a sheet to an existing sibling's name (or to an empty/whitespace-only name) now toasts an error and aborts; the previous version silently accepted the rename and left a confusing duplicate or blank-named tab.

### Tests

- 74/74 (was 66). New: 8 sheet-rename scenarios — straight rename, multiple refs to same sheet, new name needing quoting, renaming a quoted name, apostrophe-in-name producing `''` escape, ranges, absolute markers preserved through rename, and only-matching-sheet specificity (an `OtherSheet!B2` stays untouched when renaming `Sheet1`).

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed (the big silent-correctness bug)

- **byteSheet formulas now follow their target cells through Insert / Delete Row + Insert / Delete Column.** Before this release, inserting a row above row 1 would leave a formula `=A1+B1` literally pointing at the new (empty) row 1 — silently wrong. Excel-style behaviour now: non-absolute refs shift with the data; absolute refs (`$A$1`, `A$1`, `$A1`) stay anchored. Refs that point AT a deleted row/column become `#REF!` in the formula text (the tokenizer rejects `#`, so the evaluator surfaces the broken cell on next eval). Sheet-qualified refs in OTHER sheets that target the modified sheet are also walked.
- `shiftRef(tk, rowOp, colOp)` and `shiftRange(tk, rowOp, colOp)` are now public exports of `sheet-formula.js`. `sheet.js` uses them in `insertRowAtActive` / `insertColAtActive` / `deleteActiveRow` / `deleteActiveCol`.

### Tests

- 66/66 (was 55). New: 11 shift-scenarios covering insert/delete row/col, absolute-ref preservation, range endpoints, cross-sheet refs, and the `#REF!` cases. A known-limitation case is also tested: deleting an absolute column (`$B$2` with delete-col B) currently leaves the absolute ref intact instead of emitting `#REF!`. Documented in the test as a v0.2 polish; the proper fix needs distinguishing "absolute-ref skips operations" from "absolute-ref breaks on target deletion".

### Known limitations carried over

- Sort still re-arranges cells but doesn't update formula refs in moved rows (the moved rows take their formulas with them as text; refs inside those formulas point at the OLD positions). Bigger redesign, deferred.
- Sheet-rename doesn't update cross-sheet refs yet — that's the v0.1.9 chunk.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-05-15

### Added (formula-engine foundation for v0.2 "spreadsheet feature parity")

- **Tokenizer emits source-position info** (`token.loc = {start, end}`) for every token, enabling lossless re-serialisation of formulas.
- **REF / RANGE tokens preserve `$` absolute-marker positions** in new `colAbs` / `rowAbs` flags (and `startCell` / `endCell` for RANGE). The existing `ref` / `start` / `end` fields stay populated as before, so the evaluator is unchanged.
- **Quoted sheet names**: formulas like `='Q1 Sales'!A1` or `=SUM('My Sheet'!$A$1:$B$5)` now parse. Excel-style `''` escape for a literal `'` is supported.
- **`rewriteFormula(formula, transform)`** — walks every REF / RANGE token, lets the transform replace its source slice, keeps everything else byte-identical. The foundation for upcoming row/column/sort-aware ref shifting and sheet-rename ref updates.
- **`refToString(parts)` / `rangeToString(start, end, sheet)`** helpers serialise parsed refs back to formula text with correct `$` markers + quoting.

### Fixed

- Tokenizer had a latent infinite-loop trap on input shaped `foo!nonref` — backed up to `i = j - 1` and re-tokenised the same word. Changed to `i = j`, which leaves `!` for the next iteration to error on cleanly.

### Tests

- Formula suite grew from 34 to 55 cases. New: absolute refs (`$A$1` etc.), quoted sheet names, round-trip identity for 13 representative formulas, `refToString` shape, and an end-to-end shift-row demonstration of the rewrite hook.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Absolute cell references (`$A$1`, `A$1`, `$A1`) were rejected by the formula tokenizer** even though the docstring at the top of `sheet-formula.js` claimed they were supported. `=$A$1+1` returned `#ERROR! unexpected char "$"`. Fix: extend the tokenizer's word-start and word-body character classes to accept `$`; the bare-ref pattern strips the dollars via `normalizeRef` (byteworkz treats refs as logically relative — `$` markers are accepted but ignored). Tests added: 34/34 pass now.

### Changed
- README no longer claims a specific LOC count or file count, and no longer pins a version inline. Both drift quickly; the source of truth is now `CHANGELOG.md` and the topbar version pill (fetched from `/version.json`).

### Repo hygiene (out-of-changelog)
- The internal pre-launch checklist (Caddy block, bind-mount path, repo references, in-session security note) was previously committed as `PUBLIC-RELEASE-PLAN.md`. That file has been replaced by a public-friendly `ROADMAP.md` and the sensitive content was purged from the entire git history via `git filter-branch` + `--force-with-lease` push. All commit SHAs prior to v0.1.6 changed as a result.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed (P0 — data loss / leak risks surfaced by line-by-line audit)

- **byteDoc tab-switch lost unsaved edits.** `setActive` copied the outgoing editor's HTML into the in-memory doc but never flushed the pending debounced save. The debounce would then fire later against the NEW active doc, dropping the outgoing tab's changes. Fix: `state.saveDebounced.flush()` before switching activeId.
- **byteDoc / byteSheet app-switch lost recent edits.** `unmount` tore down without flushing the pending save. Same root cause as above on a larger scope. Fix: flush in both unmounts.
- **byteSheet doc-switch lost edits.** Navigating between two existing sheets within the debounce window (700ms) caused the pending save to fire against the new `state.doc` and discard the previous sheet's edits. Fix: flush before `state.doc` is replaced in mount.
- **byteDoc "Insert image" required selecting the file twice.** `doInsertImage` called `file.openPicker` (which read the file as text and discarded it) AND `pickImageAsDataURL` (which prompted the user again). Fix: drop the first picker, use only the FileReader-based one.
- **byteDoc image-resize leaked 5 listeners per image click.** The `_cleanup` callback was defined but never invoked, and it only covered 2 of the 5 listeners. Fix: register all 5 (mousemove + mouseup + 3× reflow), call `_cleanup()` from `clearImgSelection`.
- **byteDoc "Export HTML" embedded find-highlight markup** when the find bar was open. Fix: `clearHighlights()` before serialising.

### Fixed (P1 — UX polish)

- **Empty Untitled docs in Recent.** Clicking the byteSheet/byteDoc tile (or "+ New") used to add an `Untitled` entry to Recent even if the user immediately navigated away. New `docs.save(doc, { silent: true })` option skips the Recent touch for the initial empty save; the first real edit triggers an ordinary save and the doc appears in Recent.
- **Recent cap leaked orphaned doc blobs.** When the Recent list overflowed beyond 20, the oldest entry was popped but its `byteworkz.docs.<id>` blob stayed in localStorage forever. Fix: also delete the underlying blob.
- **byteSheet `selectAll` didn't sync the formula bar** to A1 after Ctrl+A — minor cosmetic.
- **`openAnyFile` always used 'd' as the generated id prefix** regardless of app type. Fix: 's' for byteSheet, 'd' for byteDoc.
- **Dead code in `setCellValueFromInput`** (`cell.f = undefined; if (cell.f === undefined) delete cell.f`) collapsed to just `delete cell.f`.

### Changed

- `ui.js` — `debounce(fn, ms)` now exposes `.flush()` (run pending call immediately + clear timer) and `.cancel()` (drop pending call). Both are needed by the unmount / app-switch flush logic.

### Known limitations carried over to v0.2 (documented)

- Formula refs don't auto-update on row/column insert/delete or on column sort — references stay literal. Mitigated for now by avoiding structural edits to data that has formulas.
- Filter is view-only (hides DOM rows, doesn't survive sheet switch / structural ops).
- Sheet rename doesn't update cross-sheet refs in other sheets.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Critical:** clicking the byteSheet hub tile (or "+ New byteSheet" button) showed "Sheet not found" instead of opening a fresh sheet. Root cause: `mount()` created a new doc in RAM, called `location.replace('#/sheet/<id>')` which fired an async `hashchange`, and the second `mount()` invocation looked the doc up in localStorage — where it wasn't yet saved — and aborted with the error. Fix: persist the new doc immediately on creation, and use `history.replaceState` for URL normalisation (silent, no second mount).
- Same fix applied symmetrically to byteDoc, which previously survived the click path thanks to its in-memory `openDocs` cache but broke on **page refresh** of `#/doc/<id>` for an unsaved new doc. Now refresh works in both apps.
- byteDoc's `newDoc()` returns an internal shape; added `persistDoc(d)` helper that wraps it in the on-disk persistence shape (`{app, version, …}`) so loaded docs round-trip correctly.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- `tests/formula.mjs` — pure-Node test suite for the formula engine (`node tests/formula.mjs`, 30/30 pass), referenced from README + CONTRIBUTING
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup, ground rules, commit-message style, architecture pointers
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` + `feature_request.md` + `config.yml` — structured issue intake, blank issues disabled

### Operations (production deploy)
- `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` for HTML/JS/CSS/JSON (ETag-revalidate every load — fixes the "users see stale JS after a bugfix" issue we hit between v0.1.0 and v0.1.1)
- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, must-revalidate` for SVG/manifest/txt

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- MIT license (`LICENSE`)
- Bilingual DE/EN imprint (`imprint.html`) and privacy notice (`privacy.html`) — full DSGVO boilerplate
- `legal-lang.js` — URL-param + browser-locale language detection with manual DE/EN toggle (no cookies, no storage)
- `info-page` styles in `styles.css` to render the legal pages
- SEO + Open Graph + Twitter Card meta tags in `index.html`
- About modal in the topbar (`?`-button) with keyboard help, version, GitHub link, imprint + privacy links
- `favicon.svg` (deep navy + accent-orange doc/sheet glyph)
- `robots.txt` + `.well-known/security.txt`
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `PUBLIC-RELEASE-PLAN.md`, `.gitignore`

### Changed
- README rewritten for a public audience (badges, live URL, install steps, contributing notes)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- Critical: ES module evaluation-order crash on initial page load. `window.ByteWorkz` was initialized in the body of `app.js`, but ES modules evaluate depth-first post-order — meaning `doc.js` and `sheet.js` ran first and crashed on `window.ByteWorkz.apps.push(…)`. Registry bootstrap is now idempotent in every app module.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- Hub launcher with hash-router (`#/`, `#/doc/<id>`, `#/sheet/<id>`)
- **byteDoc** — contenteditable editor: format toolbar (B/I/U/strike, H1–H3, lists, align L/C/R/J, link, quote), tables (insert + context menu), images (DataURL inline with corner-drag resize), find/replace with highlighting, multi-document tabs, live word/char count, autosave to localStorage, JSON download/open + HTML export
- **byteSheet** — spreadsheet: 26×100 grid, sticky headers, range selection, formula bar, formulas (`=A1+B2`, `=SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/COUNT/IF/CONCAT/AND/OR/NOT/ABS/ROUND/SQRT/POWER/LEN/UPPER/LOWER/TRIM/MOD/INT`), cross-sheet refs (`Sheet2!A1`), cell formatting (bold/italic/align/color/background/number-format), copy/paste TSV, sort/filter, multi-sheet tabs, insert/delete rows + columns, charts (bar/line/pie, canvas-rendered, draggable), CSV export, JSON save/open
- Persistence via `localStorage` (recent list + per-doc storage) with FIFO quota eviction
- Shared dark theme aligned with byteside-voidcore design tokens
- Voidcore-ready app registry (`window.ByteWorkz.apps`) for future Voidcore window embedding
- Pure-vanilla ES6, no build step, no backend
